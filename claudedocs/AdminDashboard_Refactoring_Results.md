## Main Component Improvements

### AdminDashboard.tsx Changes

- **Removed**: 393 lines of embedded component code
- **Added**: 3 import statements for extracted components
- **Maintained**: All existing functionality and API compatibility
- **Focused on**: Tab management, layout coordination, and editor state management

### Code Organization Benefits

- **Single Responsibility**: Each component now has a clear, single purpose
- **Reusability**: useAdminList hook can be used for future admin lists
- **Maintainability**: Easier to modify individual list behaviors
- **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
- **Consistency**: Shared patterns through useAdminList hook

## Technical Patterns Applied

### DRY Principle

- Extracted common CRUD patterns into useAdminList hook
- Eliminated duplicate error handling and loading states
- Centralized Lithuanian display name logic

### SOLID Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Each component handles one list type
- **Open/Closed**: useAdminList hook is extensible for new table types
- **Interface Segregation**: Clean, focused component interfaces

### Component Architecture

- **Container/Presentation**: AdminDashboard coordinates, lists present data
- **Hook Pattern**: Shared business logic through custom hook
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety maintained throughout refactoring

## Validation Results

- **Build Test**: ✅ Successful (`npm run build:dev`)
- **Functionality**: ✅ All existing features preserved
- **Type Safety**: ✅ No TypeScript errors
- **API Compatibility**: ✅ No breaking changes to component interfaces

## Future Benefits

1. **Easier Maintenance**: Individual list components can be modified independently
2. **Code Reuse**: useAdminList hook ready for new admin list components
3. **Testing**: Each component can be unit tested in isolation
4. **Feature Addition**: New admin lists can be quickly built using the shared hook
5. **Performance**: Better tree shaking and code splitting opportunities

## File Structure Impact
